**CPU Garden**

The goal is to create very simple software renderer, so I could use it for fun projecs, such as experiment with 10...0 particles, or implement Game Of Life, or create arcade racing game, whatever.

I am going to make everything from scratch, completely independent of any libraries, for Windows, Linux and macOS.

**Work In Progress!**

## Building

### macOS

```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./garden
```

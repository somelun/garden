**CPU Sandbox**

The goal is to create simple sandbox, so I could use it for fun projecs, such as experiment with 1000000 particles, or implement game of life, or create arcade racing game. You get the idea.

My aim is make it from scratch, completely independent of any libraries, but supporting for window, linux and mac os.

**Work In Progress!**

**CPU Garden**

The goal is to create simple software renderer, so I could use it for fun projecs, such as experiment with 100...0 particles, or implement game of life, or create arcade racing game, whatever.
I am going to make everything from scratch, completely independent of any libraries, for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

**Work In Progress!**

## Building

### Mac OS

```cmd
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./garden
```
